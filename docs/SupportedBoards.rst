Streaming Board
------------------

BrainFlow's boards can stream data to different destinations like file, socket and so on. This board acts like a consumer for data streamed from the main process.

**To use it in the first process you should call:**

.. code-block:: python

    # choose any valid multicast address(from "224.0.0.0" to "239.255.255.255") and port
    start_stream (450000, 'streaming_board://225.1.1.1:6677')

**In the second process please specify:**

- board_id: -2
- ip_address field of BrainFlowInputParams structure, for example above it's 225.1.1.1
- ip_port field of BrainFlowInputParams structure, for example above it's 6677
- other_info field of BrainFlowInputParams structure, write there board_id for a board which acts like data provider(master board)

Supported platforms:

- Windows >= 8.1
- Linux
- MacOS

In methods like:

.. code-block:: python

   get_eeg_channels (board_id)
   get_emg_channels (board_id)
   get_ecg_channels (board_id)
   # .......

You need to use master board id instead Streaming Board Id, because exact data format for streaming board is controlled by master board as well as sampling rate.

Board Specs:

- num eeg(emg,...) channels: like in master board
- num acceleration channels: like in master board
- sampling rate: like in master board
- communication: UDP multicast socket to read data from master board

Synthetic Board
----------------

This board generates synthetic data and you dont need real hardware to use it.

**It can be extremely useful during development.**

To choose this board in BoardShim constructor please specify:

- board_id: -1
- you dont need to set any fields in BrainFlowInputParams structure

Supported platforms:

- Windows >= 8.1
- Linux
- MacOS
- Android

Board Specs:

- num eeg(emg,...) channels: 8
- num acceleration channels: 3
- sampling rate: 256
- communication: None
