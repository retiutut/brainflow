User API
==========

BrainFlow User API has only two classes:

- BoardShim to read data from a board, it calls methods from underlying BoardController library
- DataFilter to perform signal processing, it calls methods from underlying DataHandler library

These classes are independent, so if you want, you can use BrainFlow API only for data streaming and perform signal processing by yourself and vice versa.

BrainFlow API is board agnostic, so **to select a specific board you need to pass BrainFlow's board id to BoardShim's constructor and an instance of BrainFlowInputParams structure** which should hold information for your specific board, check :ref:`supported-boards-label`. for details.
This abstraction allows you to switch boards without any changes in code.

In BoardShim, all board data is returned as a 2d array. Rows in this array may contain timestamps: EEG and EMG data and so on. To see instructions how to query specific kind of data check :ref:`data-format-label` and :ref:`code-samples-label`.

R API Reference
-----------------

R binding is a wrapper on top of Python binding. It is implemented using `reticulate <https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/>`_.

Check R samples to see how to use it.
